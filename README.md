# M-Arc_Reactor
This repository contains all STL files required for printing of M-Arc photoreactor

These designs have been published and benchmarked as reported in 'An Accessible and Efficient 3D printed Modular ‘M-Arc’ Photoreactor' (published in Reaction Chemistry & Engineering, DOI:)

The reactor allows full integration of Kessil or Hepatochem LED sources. Fusion 360 has been used for design of all reactor components, educational access is available for most universities.
STL files are available for modification or  direct printing using an appropriate 3D printing slicing software.

The M-Arc reactor comes with modular 'carousel' files to suit researcher needs. Navigate to the appropriate folder to see the range available.
